Scheduling terms

1. Arrival time: process arrived in ready queue
2. Complete time: time at which process completed its execution
3. Burst time: time required by cpu to execute a process
4. Turnaround time: completion time - arrival time
5. Waiting time: Turnaround time - Burst time
6. Response time: First time when process gets the cpu

Why do we need scheduling?
    no starvation
    maximum cpu utilization

Objectives of cpu scheduling algorithm
1. Max cpu utilization
2. Minimum waiting time
3. Minimum turn around time
4. Minimum response time
5. Minimum context switch time
6. Max throughput
7. Fair cpu scheduling (allocation)
