Types of CPU schedulers:

1. Long term scheduler:
    makes decision about how many process should go in ready queue
    it also determines the degree of multiprogramming
2. Short term scheduler - Context Switching time:
    it decides which process should be executed next
    and then it calls the dispacher to switch the context
    dispacher is repository of context switching
3. Medium term - swapping time:
    moving process from memory to disk




Degree of multiprogramming

the number of processes that are present in ready queue
