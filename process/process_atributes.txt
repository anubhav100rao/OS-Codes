1. Process Id:    A unique identifier assigned by the operating system
2. Process State: Can be ready, running, etc.
3. CPU registers: Like the Program Counter (CPU registers must be saved and 
                  restored when a process is swapped in and out of CPU)
5. Accounts information:
6. I/O status information: For example, devices allocated to the process, 
                           open files, etc
8. CPU scheduling information: For example, Priority (Different processes 
                               may have different priorities, for example
                               a shorter process assigned high priority
                               in the shortest job first scheduling)

Every process has its own PCB (Process Control Bloack)
        A process control block (PCB) is a data structure used by computer operating systems
        to store all the information about a process. It is also known as a process descriptor.
        When a process is created (initialized or installed), the operating system creates a corresponding
        process control block.
it includes the following information:
1. Process identification (pid)
2. Process data state
3. Process Control
    3.1 Process scheduling state
    3.2 Process priority
    3.3 Process CPU time
    3.4 Process I/O time
    3.5 Process memory size
    3.6 Interprocess communication (IPC)
    3.7 Process accounting information
    3.8 Process I/O status information
    3.9 memory management information
