Lock variable in process synchronization solution

(No os help is needed.)
busy waiting solution

other process keeps asking about the lock variable. ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

entry point:
    requesting critical_section entry point
    if lock == 0:
        enter critical_section
        lock = 1
    else:
        busy waiting
exit point:
    lock = 0

process() {
    entry_section(int process) {
        while(lock != 0) {
            busy waiting
        }
        lock = 1
    }
    critical_section(int process) {
        // do something
    }
    exit_section(int process) {
        lock = 0
    }

    remainder_section() {
        // do something
    }
}

***********problems with this solution**************
1. busy waiting
2. lock variable is not atomic
3. lock variable is not thread safe
4. lock variable is not reentrant

5. both processes can be in critical_section at the same time ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”
