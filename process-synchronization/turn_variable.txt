Strict Iteration or Turn variable

// only 2 process solution

process_1() {
    while(true) {
        non_critical_code();
        while(turn != 1) {
            wait();
        }
        turn = 0;
    }
}

process_0() {
    while(true) {
        non_critical_code();
        while(turn != 0) {
            wait();
        }
        turn = 1;   
    }
}

problems of this solution:
1. if there is a deadlock, the program will be stuck in the while(true) loop
2. intrested process will be stuck in the while(true) loop
3. No progress will be made ðŸ’¦ðŸ’¦
